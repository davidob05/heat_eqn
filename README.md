# heat_eqn
A program that approximates the solution to the 1D heat equation

    u_t = alpha * u_xx,   0 < x < L

on a rod with both ends held at 0. The initial state is a sine mode, `u(x, 0) = sin(mode * pi * x / L)`, and the solution is stepped forward with the explicit FTCS (forward-time, centred-space) scheme. Each snapshot is written alongside the exact solution, `u(x, t) = exp(-alpha * (mode * pi / L)^2 * t) * sin(mode * pi * x / L)`, so the error can be read straight from the output.

# Instructions

## Requirements
 - C++17 compiler
 - CMake 3.25 or newer
 - First configure downloads Catch2 so internet is needed
 - Python 3 with `numpy` and `matplotlib` (only for `scripts/plot.py`)

## Build debug
```bash
cmake --preset debug
cmake --build --preset debug
ctest --preset debug
./build/debug/Main
```

## Build release
```bash
cmake --preset release
cmake --build --preset release
ctest --preset release
./build/release/Main
```

## Debug vs Release
Debug is for development (warnings are errors, AddressSanitizer is on), release is for real, optimised runs.

## Running
`Main` runs one simulation and writes a CSV. Every flag is optional; anything left out keeps its default. Run it from the project root, because the default output path is relative.

```bash
./build/release/Main --n-intervals 50 --T 0.05 --mode 2 --snapshots 4 --output results/mode2.csv
```

| Flag | Meaning | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `--n-intervals <int>` | number of intervals along the rod (max 10,000,000) | 100 |
| `--length <double>` | rod length `L` | 1.0 |
| `--alpha <double>` | diffusivity | 1.0 |
| `--T <double>` | target time | 0.1 |
| `--r-req <double>` | requested `r = alpha * dt / dx^2` | 0.4 |
| `--mode <int>` | sine mode of the initial state (not 0) | 1 |
| `--snapshots <int>` | snapshots written after the initial state | 5 |
| `--output <path>` | output CSV path | `results/output.csv` |
| `--help`, `-h` | print usage | |

Values may be given as `--flag value` or `--flag=value`.

The number of time steps `n` is `ceil(T / dt_req)`, where `dt_req = r_req * dx^2 / alpha`. The step is then shrunk to `dt = T / n`, so the run ends exactly at `T` and the `r` actually used can be a little below `r_req`.

The run writes to `<output>.tmp` and renames it over the target only on success, so a failed run never overwrites an existing result.

### Warnings
Warnings are printed to stderr and do not stop the run:
 - `r` above 0.5 (the scheme is unstable)
 - mode too high for the number of intervals (`|mode| * 10 > n_intervals`)
 - the state decays almost to zero by `T`, so the error margin may be misleading
 - the initial function is not close to 0 at the left or right end

### Output format
CSV with the header `t,x,u_numeric,u_exact`. The first block is the initial state at `t = 0`, followed by one block per snapshot. Each block has one row per grid point (`n_intervals + 1` rows). Values are written with enough digits to round-trip exactly.

## Plotting
```bash
python3 scripts/plot.py [path/to/output.csv]
```
The path defaults to `results/output.csv`. Generated CSVs in `results/` are git-ignored.

## Project layout
```
src/
  core/       Grid and initial-state construction
  solver/     FTCS time step, step-parameter calculation, step loop
  verifier/   Sine initial function and exact solution
  writer/     CSV output
  driver/     run_simulation (validation, snapshots, warnings) and the CLI parser
  main.cpp    Command-line entry point
tests/        Catch2 unit tests, one file per module
scripts/      plot.py
results/      Default output location
```
The `src` modules other than `main.cpp` are built into the `heat_solver` library, which both `Main` and `unit_tests` link against.
